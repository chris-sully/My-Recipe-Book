# My Recipe Book

## Description
An application that can be used to store your favorite recipes. Users can add their own recipes to easily store their favorites. Users can sign up and login to save their information so itâ€™s all in one convenient spot. This application was created so that there is a new convenient way to share and store recipies. This will also help with indecisiveness when choosing a meal.

## Installation
In the .env.example file, fill in DB_USER spot with 'root' and the DB_PASSWORD with your mysql password in quotations
and then delete .example so the file is named .env

In your terminal run the command, npm install

Then in the command line run, mysql -u root -p , and input your password

Next, in the msql shell run the command, source db/schema.sql; 

From there, open a new terminal and input the command npm run seed
